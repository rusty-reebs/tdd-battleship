# Battleship TDD project â›´

**Battleship game with test-driven-development, written in plain JavaScript.**  

**This code has many refactoring/additional feature opportunities, including:**
- defining ships one time, therefore using fewer arrays
- a shuffle ships function instead of location.reload()
- manual ship placement with mouseover events

Date completed: November 2, 2021  

Objectives: use Jest unit tests to develop the classic game of Battleship. Organize code with factory functions and modules. Keep DOM manipulation separate from game logic.
